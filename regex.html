    <h1>Regular expressions</h1>
    <br>
    <p class="noindent"><i>What follows is documentation borrowed from
        the Linux man pages. It has been modified to reflect what can be
        used as a My Secret Box complex search command:</i><br>
    </p>
    <p>A <b><font color="#ff0000"><i>regular expression</i></font></b>
      (RE) is one or more nonempty <i>branches</i>, separated by '|'.
      It matches anything that matches one or more of the branches. The
      <i>branch </i>operator '|' can be thought of as an "or' operator.
      For example, to find all of the entries that contain either the
      word "book" or "look", one could specify any of the following REs:
      "book|look", "(book)|(look)", "(b|l)ook", or "((b|l)ook)".</p>
    <p>A <b><font color="#ff0000"><i>branch </i></font></b>is one or
      more <i>pieces</i>, concatenated. It matches a match for the
      first, followed by a match for the second, and so on.<br>
    </p>
    <p>A <b><font color="#ff0000"><i>piece </i></font></b>is an <i>atom</i><i>
      </i>possibly followed by a single '*', '+', '?', a <i>bound</i>,
      or <i>approximate match settings</i>. An atom followed by '*'
      matches a sequence of 0 or more matches of the atom. An atom
      followed by '+' matches a sequence of 1 or more matches of the
      atom. An atom followed by '?' matches a sequence of 0 or 1 matches
      of the atom. Adding a ? after a '*', '+', '?', or <i>bound</i>
      makes the sub-expression minimal, or non-greedy. Normally a
      repeated expression is greedy, that is, it matches as many
      characters as possible. A non-greedy sub-expression matches as few
      characters as possible. Note that this does not (always) mean the
      same thing as matching as many or few repetitions as possible.<br>
    </p>
    <p>An <b><font color="#ff0000"><i>atom </i></font></b>is a <i>regular



























        expression</i> enclosed in "()" (matching a match for the
      regular expression), an empty set of "()" (matching the null
      string), a <i>bracket expression</i> (see below), '.' (matching
      any single character), '^' (matching the null string at the
      beginning of a line), '$' (matching the null string at the end of
      a line), an <i>assertion, </i>a '\' followed by one of the
      characters "^.[$()|*+?{\" (matching that character taken as an
      ordinary character), a '\' followed by any other character (except
      an <i>assertion character</i>) will interpret that character as
      if the '\' were not present, a <i>comment</i>, an <i>option</i>,
      or a single character (<i>literal</i>) with no other significance.
      A '{' followed by a character other than a digit, space, or one of
      the characters "~+-&lt;" is an ordinary character, not the
      beginning of a bound. It is illegal to end an RE with '\' or '{'.</p>
    <p>A <b><font color="#ff0000"><i>bound</i> </font></b>is '{'
      followed by an unsigned decimal integer, possibly followed by ','
      possibly followed by another unsigned decimal integer, always
      followed by '}'. The integers must lie between 0 and 255
      inclusive, and if there are two of them, the first may not exceed
      the second. An atom followed by a bound containing one integer <i>i</i>
      and no comma matches a sequence of exactly <i>i</i> matches of
      the atom. An atom followed by a bound containing one integer <i>i</i>
      and a comma matches a sequence of <i>i</i> or more matches of the
      atom. An atom followed by a bound containing two integers <i>i</i>
      and <i>j</i> matches a sequence of <i>i</i> through <i>j</i>
      (inclusive) matches of the atom. Note that minimal repetitions are
      not currently supported for approximate matching.<br>
    </p>
    <p>A <font color="#ff0000"><b><i>bracket expression</i></b></font>
      is a list of characters enclosed in "[]". It normally matches any
      single character from the list (but see below). If the list begins
      with '^', it matches any single character (but see below) <i>not</i>
      from the rest of the list. If two characters in the list are
      separated by '-', this is shorthand for the full <i>range</i> of
      characters between those two (inclusive) in the collating
      sequence, for example, "[0-9]" matches any decimal digit. It is
      illegal for two ranges to share an endpoint, for example, "<i>a-c-e</i>".



























      Note that the default collating sequence can change with locale. </p>
    <p>To include a <i>literal </i>']' in the list, make it the first
      character (following a possible '^'). To include a literal '-',
      make it the first or last character, or the second endpoint of a
      range. To use a literal '-' as the first endpoint of a range,
      enclose it in "[." and ".]" to make it a collating element (see
      below). With the exception of these and some combinations using
      '[' (see next paragraphs), all other special characters, including
      '\', lose their special significance within a bracket expression.</p>
    <p>Within a <i>bracket expression</i>, a <font color="#ff0000"><b><i>collating



























            element</i></b></font> (a character, a multi-character
      sequence that collates as if it were a single character, or a
      collating-sequence name for either) enclosed in "[." and ".]"
      stands for the sequence of characters of that collating element.
      The sequence is a single element of the bracket expressionï¿½s list.
      A bracket expression containing a multi-character collating
      element can thus match more than one character, for example, if
      the collating sequence includes a "ch" collating element, then the
      RE "[[.ch.]]*c" matches the first five characters of "chchcc".</p>
    <p>Within a <i>bracket expression</i>, a <i>collating element</i>
      enclosed in "[=" and "=]" is an <font color="#ff0000"><b><i>equivalence



























            class</i></b></font>, standing for the sequences of
      characters of all <i>collating elements</i> equivalent to that
      one, including itself. (If there are no other equivalent <i>collating




























        elements</i>, the treatment is as if the enclosing delimiters
      were "[." and ".]".) For example, if o and ^ are the members of an
      <i>equivalence class</i>, then "[[=o=]]", "[[=<b>^=]]</b>", and
      "[o<b>^]</b>" are all synonymous. An <i>equivalence class</i> may
      not be an endpoint of a range.</p>
    <p>Within a <i>bracket expression</i>, the name of a <font
        color="#ff0000"><b><i>character class</i></b></font> enclosed in
      "[:" and ":]" stands for the list of all characters belonging to
      that class. Note that this implies double square brackets are
      required to use a <i>character class</i> name in a bracket
      expression. E.g., RE "firewall[0-9]" is equivalent to
      "firewall[[:digit:]]". Standard <i>character class</i> names are:</p>
    <blockquote>

  </blockquote>     
    <p>&nbsp;A non-English locale may provide others. A <i>character
        class</i> may not be used as an endpoint of a range.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Within an <i>atom</i>, an <font color="#ff0000"><b><i>assertion
          </i></b></font>is a shorthand that utilizes <i>assertion-characters</i>
      for specifying certain <i>boundaries </i>and <i>character
        classes</i>. <i>Assertion-characters </i>are always prefixed
      by a '\'.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The recognized <font color="#ff0000"><b><i>assertion-character</i></b></font>s
      are as follows:</p>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">
        <li class="no-padding">&lt; - Beginning of word </li>
        <li class="no-padding">&gt; - End of word </li>
        <li class="no-padding">b - Word boundary </li>
        <li class="no-padding">B - Non-word boundary </li>
        <li class="no-padding">d - Digit character (equivalent to
          [[:digit:]]) </li>
        <li class="no-padding">D - Non-digit character (equivalent to
          [^[:digit:]]) </li>
        <li class="no-padding">s - Space character (equivalent to
          [[:space:]]) </li>
        <li class="no-padding">S - Non-space character (equivalent to
          [^[:space:]]) </li>
        <li class="no-padding">w - Word character (equivalent to
          [[:alnum:]_]) </li>
        <li class="no-padding">W - Non-word character (equivalent to
          [^[:alnum:]_]) </li>
      </font>
    </ul>
    <p>A <font color="#ff0000"><b><i>literal </i></b></font>is either
      an ordinary character (a character that has no other significance
      in the context), an 8 bit hexadecimal encoded character (e.g.
      \x1B), a wide hexadecimal encoded character (e.g. \x{263a}), or an
      escaped character. An escaped character is a \ followed by any
      character, and matches that character. Escaping can be used to
      match characters which have a special meaning in RE syntax. A \
      cannot be the last character of a RE. Escaping also allows you to
      include a few non-printable characters in the regular expression.
      These special escape sequences include: </p>
    <ul class="no-bullets">
      <font face="Courier New, Courier, monospace">
        <li class="no-padding">\a - Bell character (ASCII code 7)</li>
        <li class="no-padding">\e - Escape character (ASCII code 27)</li>
        <li class="no-padding">\f - Form-feed character (ASCII code 12)</li>
        <li class="no-padding">\n - New-line/line-feed character (ASCII
          code 10)</li>
        <li class="no-padding">\r - Carriage return character (ASCII
          code 13)</li>
        <li class="no-padding">\t - Horizontal tab character (ASCII code
          9)</li>
      </font>
    </ul>
    <p>My Secret Box strips off New-line, Form-feed, and Carriage return
      characters so they will never appear in the name of a secret.
      However, if any of the other characters were inadvertently entered
      into a secret's name, the above codes can be used to search for
      them. The use of these special characters in secret names is
      strongly discouraged.<br>

          defined.<br>
        </font></font></p>
    <p><i>An approximate </i><i>matching setting</i> is a list of
      characters enclosed in "{}". The characters must specify either
      one or more <i>count-limits</i> and/or a <i>cost-equation</i>. A
      <i>count-limit</i> begins with one of the characters "+-#~" and is
      followed by a number. Multiple <i>count-limits </i>can be
      concatenated. A <i>cost-equation </i>is zero or more <i>cost-terms</i>
      followed by the <i>maximum allowed cost</i>.</p>
    <p> The <font color="#ff0000"><b><i>count-limits</i></b></font> can
      be used to set limits for the number of insertions (<tt>+</tt>),
      deletions (<tt>-</tt>), substitutions (<tt>#</tt>), and total
      number of errors (<tt>~</tt>). If the number part is omitted, the
      specified error count will be unlimited.<br>
    </p>
    <p>A <font color="#ff0000"><b><i>cost-term</i></b></font> is a
      number with one of the characters "ids" appended to it. No space
      is permitted between the number and the letter. The <font
        color="#ff0000"><b><i>maximum allowed cost</i></b></font> is a
      number prefaced by the character "&lt;".<br>
    </p>
    <p> The <font color="#ff0000"><b><i>cost-equation</i></b></font>
      can be thought of as a mathematical equation consisting of a sum
      of <i>cost-terms</i>, where <tt>i</tt>, <tt>d</tt>, and <tt>s</tt>
      stand for the number of insertions, deletions, and substitutions,
      respectively. Each <i>cost-term</i> (<tt>i</tt>, <tt>d</tt>, and
      <tt>s)</tt> can have a multiplier. The multiplier is the cost of
      that error, and the number after <tt>&lt;</tt> is the <i>maximum
        allowed cost</i> of a match. Spaces and pluses can be inserted
      to make the equation readable. In fact, when specifying only a
      cost equation, adding a space after the opening <tt>{</tt> is <strong>required</strong>.

        <p>Notes:<br>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>In the event that a RE could match more than one
            sub-string of a given string, the RE matches the one
            starting earliest in the string. If the RE could match more
            than one sub-string starting at that point, it matches the
            longest. Sub-expressions also match the longest possible
            sub-strings subject to the constraint that the whole match
            be as long as possible (with sub-expressions starting
            earlier in the RE taking priority over ones starting later).
            Note that higher-level sub-expressions thus take priority
            over their lower-level component sub-expressions.</li>
          <li>Match lengths are measured in characters, not collating
            elements. A null string is considered longer than no match
            at all. For example, "bb*" matches the three middle
            characters of "abbbc", "(wee|week)(knights|nights)" matches
            all ten characters of "weeknights", when "(.*).*" is matched
            against "abc" the parenthesized sub-expression matches all
            three characters, and when "(a*)*" is matched against "bc"
            both the whole RE and the parenthesized sub-expression match
            the null string.</li>
          <li>If case-independent matching is specified, the effect is
            much as if all case distinctions had vanished from the
            alphabet. When an alphabetic that exists in multiple cases
            appears as an ordinary character outside a bracket
            expression, it is effectively transformed into a bracket
            expression containing both cases, for example, 'x' becomes
            "[xX]". When it appears inside a bracket expression, all
            case counterparts of it are added to the bracket expression,
            so that, for example, "[x]" becomes "[xX]" and "[^x]"
            becomes "[^xX]".</li>
          <li>The "." operator overrides case sensitivity. It will match
            any character regardless of the setting of the case
            sensitivity option.<br>
          </li>
          <li>REs can be no longer than 254 bytes.</li>
          <li>Back references are not supported.<br>
          </li>
          <li>The author has not tested collating elements or equivalent
            classes in <font color="#ff0000"><font color="#000000">the
                My Secret Box complex search box. According to source
